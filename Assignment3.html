<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>Our program is an online communication program aimed at connecting doctors and pharmacists in real time. This program allows for a streamlined means of communication to allow for on the fly script amendments, queries and alterations. This program resolves the ongoing issue of communication delay between both parties which can ultimately lead to a delay in a patient receiving their script or even potentially patients receiving incorrect medication. </p>

<h2>Topic</h2>

<p>Our idea is to create an application network where health professionals and pharmacists can quickly and efficiently communicate with each other for patient-based specialised services and queries. It would focus predominantly on creating a direct line of communication between doctors (in both hospitals and private practices) and pharmacists (in both public and community settings). It would be available on desktop via a cloud service, this would be powered by cloud computing software, specifically Amazon Web Services (AWS). The program would also ideally be integrated with existing industry standard software used in the health space. </p>

<p>This project has come about from personal experience (Christopher McLeod) working in the healthcare space. Communication between pharmacists and doctors is practiced already in the industry as it’s such an important part of providing quality care to patients, but the methods used are time consuming and dated. Usually communication is via fax, phone, or email, with additional barriers at each step. A new state-wide system needs to be implemented to vastly improve the time taken out of healthcare workers days trying to communicate sometimes complex problems with one another before coming to a solution. “A review of medication safety from the National Prescribing Service show approximately 6% of hospital admissions are associated with adverse drug events and high error rates during transfer of care. Poor communication was the most important common factor contributing to medication errors. Increased interprofessional collaboration between doctors and pharmacists could therefore reduce the considerable medication-related morbidity and mortality" Easton K. (2009). </p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>After speaking directly with both pharmacists and a local Doctor, Christopher McLeod found that both would appreciate and benefit from such a system. Put simply, the benefit of this application would be to have a secure and direct line of communication between doctors, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals to avoid any errors. We hope this app will help with common errors that occur due to today's lack of professional communication. Common errors included: Duplication of therapy (either getting two of the same medication or two drugs in the same class). Omitted but necessary medications. Unreported use of herbals or dietary supplements TheConversation.com (2018). Common mistakes on prescriptions and issues with transferring of care can take up to 48 hours to resolve using today’s industry standard of communication between professionals. </p>

<p>This is an important application in the medical world and will help not just the doctors and pharmacists but ultimately the patients.  It is important to patients by reducing incorrect treatment being given which may result in needing further medical care (attendance to hospital for example) but on a less severe point it will also save the patient time by ensuring the information given to the pharmacist is able to be questioned instantly rather than having to send the patient away to return to see their doctor.  The application will fit within current IT trends, especially in the space of Cloud Computing and Mobile Apps, two of the highest trends in Information Technology.  Equally important as the trends themselves is the need to keep information safe, something we have done with our App which includes end-to-end data encryption.  Developing this app demonstrates our group’s ability to not only think strategically, looking to the future for better and more efficient ways of doing things, but also demonstrates the technical knowledge to be able to develop the application. </p>

<h2>Landscape</h2>

<p>There are similar platforms that are approved by the Australian Government and are endorsed by The Pharmacy Guild of Australia, such as Prescription Exchange Services (PES) like eRx Script Exchange and MediSecure. <strong>(PGA, 2020:1)</strong>
These two platforms are considered Electronic Transfer of Prescriptions (ETP) applications and allow patient prescriptions to be transferred from the prescribing service to the pharmacy in question.<strong> (PGA, 2020:1)</strong>.
</p>

<p>However, unlike our MedCONNECT platform, these services are used as sending these prescriptions securely only and do not take advantage of MedCONNECT’s primary focus of allowing communication between doctors and pharmacists to rectify any mistakes made and prevent financial and medical harm. <strong>(MediSecure, n.d) (eRx, n.d)</strong></p>

<p>We believe that our product will therefore be the best platform within our medical field landscape as we allow communication between these parties on top of acting as a ETP platform. This will reduce the risk of miscommunication between both parties and any medical errors, which is further outlined below.
However, it is essential that we act fast in our development and trademark our IP as having this communication feature to ensure we can remain viable within this landscape for many years to come.</p>

<h2>Project Aim</h2>

<p>Our group intends to make what is a certain life-saving idea into a sure-fire reality, which became even more prevalent when we found that this idea solved such a costly and serious problem within our society. To put this into perspective, medical errors in Australia alone result in there being $1.2B in estimated costs to the public health sector annually <strong>(ACSQHC, n.d)</strong>. </p>

<p>Our project came together from a collaboration of problem-solving perspectives to determine how we can prevent medication errors because of poor communication between medical professionals, such as doctors and pharmacists, and how we could turn this idea into a reality.</p>

<p>Our aim is simply as follows:</p>

<p><strong>To provide a reliable, professional, and robust communicative platform to all doctors and pharmacists to prevent unintentional harm to customers by way of medical error.</strong></p>

<p>We know that ideas are only as good as the effort behind them in turning them into a reality. Our team has been working hard over the past few weeks developing a minimum viable product as a proof of concept of our MedCONNECT platform that best attempts to achieve our aim. To fulfil our aim, we have set a few goals. In order from top priority to lower priority, they are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>1.	(PRIMARY GOAL) DEVELOP AND TEST WORKING MEDCONNECT PROTOTYPE (MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT – MVP):</strong></p>
<p>This has been our main goal in achieving our aim at this current point in time. We have been working and collaborating with each other to design a simple and effective product as a proof of concept.
As Chris has been working within the industry and knows firsthand the amount of additional work miscommunication can bring between doctors and pharmacists, his prior knowledge has been paramount in instructing and assisting our group in knowing how to best approach and achieve our aim. The prototype of the MedCONNECT platform’s primary focus is to allow our doctors and pharmacists a platform to communicate, to have data stored securely via AWS IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and to have a simple UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience).
</p>

<p>MedCONNECT can be focussed to have more functions within scope down the track, such as allowing video/audio contact via a VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) approach and a QR (Quick Response) code scan function for electronic script recognition.
Once we are satisfied with our application, we need to get the prototype tested to ensure it meets our primary goal and satisfies our aim.
</p>

<p><strong>2.	TRADEMARK THE MEDCONNECT PLATFORM:</strong></p>
<p>Despite there being comparable products on the market in the medical landscape as mentioned above, such as Electronic Transfer of Prescriptions (ETP) platforms such as MediSecure and eRx, we are confident that via our implementation of our primary goal we will have a competitive design and future industry standard platform on our hands. As such, we will require undergoing legal procedures under Australian Copyright law of Trademarking our MedCONNECT platform to prevent any copyright or intellectual property loss. This will cost around $200 to complete a pre-application for a Trademark <strong>(IPAustralia, 2021)</strong>. However, to prevent any loss of Intellectual Property, it may be worth consulting a solicitor with a solid baseline of knowledge on IP law to cover our bases.</p>

<p><strong>3.	AFFILIATE WITH PHARMACY GUILD OF AUSTRALIA (PGA):</strong></p>
<p>The Pharmacy Guild of Australia is an Australian wide organisation that represents and promotes pharmacies around the nation (PGA, n.d). As such, they act on behalf of pharmacies around the country and work alongside the Australian Government. As a result, before anything relating to our pharmaceutical platform is released or before approaching any organisations, we should approach the PGA with our proof of concept and negotiate where we can implement a small test control group.</p>

<p><strong>4.	HAVE MEDCONNECT USED IN SMALL CONTROL GROUPS AND OBTAIN FEEDBACK:</strong></p>
<p>Upon completion of our primary goal, and upon successfully protecting the next logical step will include having the prototype being used amongst several willing pharmacies and a singular hospitals. This will allow us to determine several aspects, such as confirming our budgeting costs for our platform’s IaaS and maintenance factors, whether the user experience is positive and how effective our platform is at achieving our aim. It is acceptable to allow anywhere from 2-4 weeks for this goal to be met as to ensure we analyse all data relevant to our platform and fix any bugs before expanding our reach.</p>

<p><strong>5.	EXPAND REACH OF MEDCONNECT:</strong></p>
<p>Upon proving our proof of concept works and fixing any issues that our UI/UX may have, we will be ready to expand our reach of our platform. This can simply be achieved by matter of word-of-mouth, such as the positive reviews and reflections of our small control group and/or approaching other pharmacies and hospitals in the vicinity. With the help of the PGA, we will have better marketability with other hospitals and pharmacies around Australia, and before long, we will need to consider future scope and marketing in the pipeline.
Do we want to become an industry standard and become subsidised under Medicare? Or do we want to run a subscription model?
How many more employees do we need to employ?
However, this goal can only be worked on upon the completion and realisation of the previous four goals.
</p>

<h2>Plans & Progess</h2>

<p>The IT Crowd project began by the group completing a survey of the possible options from each member. </p>

<p>The preferred project idea was initially selected as being Alistair’s mobile motor vehicle claims application.  After further group discussion and elaborating on the projects a change was decided and we went with that of our resident “Chemist in the making”, Christopher McLeod’s idea of developing software that connects Chemists to Doctors.</p>

<p>Chris was experiencing first-hand the challenges and frustrations that occur daily in a Chemist when customers attend only to find that the script they have presented is incorrect in some way.  From this Chris came up with the idea that customers and medical practitioners alike could benefit from a software or application that offers a form of professional connection platform which puts them in touch with one another in times of a customer delivering a script to a Chemist which is incomplete, or incorrect.  It would focus predominantly on creating a direct line of communication between doctors (in both hospitals and private practices) and pharmacists (in both public and community settings). It would be available on desktop via a cloud service, this would be powered by cloud computing software.  Common script errors included: Duplication of therapy (either getting two of the same medication or two drugs in the same class). Omitted but necessary medications. Unreported use of herbals or dietary supplements. Mistakes on prescriptions and issues with transferring of care can take up to 48 hours to resolve using today’s standard of communication between professionals.</p>

<p>As we began working in earnest on the project we first came up with a rough idea of what we thought would be required to get a mock project up and running, this included a high-level list of the tools and technologies required to build the application.  Chis did some of his own research and came up with the below list of tools and technologies to further develop into our project:</p>

<p><strong>Amazon SNS - Fast, flexible, fully managed push messaging service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon Cognito - Simple and Secure User Sign-Up, Sign-In, and Access Control.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon Pinpoint - Targeted Push Notifications for Mobile Apps.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon S3 - Secure, durable, and scalable object storage infrastructure.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon CloudFront - Web service to distribute content to end users with low latency and high transfer speeds.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon API Gateway - Publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon CloudFront - Web service to distribute content to end users with low latency and high transfer speeds.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon SQS - Scalable queue for storing messages as they travel between computers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AWS Amplify Hosting - Fully managed CI/CD and hosting service for fast, secure, and reliable static websites and server-side rendered web apps.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AWS ChatQL is a tool we would use to implement the ability to send chats.</strong></p>

<p>As we began trying to research the above list it became clear that we would not have either the time or the required knowledge and skill set to fully develop the application using all of the above.  It would require significant learning on majority of these listings to get a good enough understanding to be able to not just use them but use them well enough to demonstrate our project.  We also explored the use of Microsoft SQL server to create a mock database however as a group decided that we would not require this level of detail for the initial presentation.  In addition, we utilised the services of a work colleague to guide us on the practicality and time required to develop a form of web-based messaging service to actually show the interaction that would occur between a doctor and a chemist, however again it was decided that this would be above our capabilities at this stage. </p>

<p>Instead, what we did do, was first discuss with Pharmacists and Doctors what features would be essential to them in a program such as MedCONNECT. We found that the fundamentals we based our program on, such as simple, secure messaging with the ability to upload either a copy of a paper-based script or E-Script (also known as eRX, which comes in the form of a QR Code) would be the most helpful and make the most sense for them in their day-to-day workflow. I suggested the idea to a local Doctor in Leichhardt if an alert system for overdue messages or requests would be helpful. The feedback received was that this would also need to be an essential part of the system, as Doctors rely heavily on their staff to ensure they are attending all requests sent to them in a timely manner. With a program like MedCONNECT this feature would be baked into the system, and much like a doctor or Pharmacist logging into the software they use each day for their respective professions, MedCONNECT we envision would be much the same. An essential part of their workflow.</p>

<p>Moving forward with the feedback we decided to first create a detailed flowchart on paper, of how the website would run. From the landing page to login page to each respective tab. We discovered at this stage some tabs would be exclusive for each profession. For example, pharmacists wouldn’t need the ability to upload a script, but Doctors would. Doctors would need to know what scripts are owing, that are yet to be written for mutual patients, whilst Pharmacists would need the ability to see what scripts they’ve requested, but not yet received. This first draft of a flowchart allowed us to see if each step was quick, easy and made sense. We initially had a landing page with only 1 login portal, we quickly realised that in a real-world use case this wouldn’t work as Dr’s would be logging in most likely with a prescriber number, which identifies that individual. Whilst each Pharmacy location would have their own login, most likely an email, as the Pharmacist in charge in many places can change during the day/week. So, we decided to create a landing page where you selected if you’re logging in as a doctor or for your Pharmacy.   </p>

<p>Deciding how to display this idea as a prototype was challenging. We knew with our limited knowledge and time constraints we could either produce a visual design of a website on a program such as Adobe InDesign/Photoshop to convey what each page would look like. Or we could use prototyping software to create an interactive website, with limited features but more accurately portrayed the UI and UX of what the end user would experience. We ultimately decided to create as best we could a prototype of the website with Proto.io. Proto.io is an application prototyping software, which allows the user to create a prototype of an application that is currently in development.  </p>

<h2>Roles</h2>

<p>Jake Bone – <strong>Content Creator</strong> </p>
<p>Christopher McLeod – <strong>Project & Technical Design</strong> </p>
<p>Alistair McLeod – <strong>Content Creator</strong> </p>
<p>Brett Russell – <strong>Research and Group Administration</strong></p>
<p>Daniel Sodeman – <strong>Technical Analyst</strong></p>


<h2>Scope and Limits</h2>

<p>In terms of development this is quite a large project to produce and implement.  Due to the limited time frame our group – The IT Crowd have decided to focus on a reduced number of key elements.  What is in scope: Software requirements specification, User task list, Developing the upfront web design demonstrating what the MedConnect App would look like.</p>

<p>Out of scope would include: Development of the interfaces required to connect and send live messages,
User acceptance testing, Approvals from government medical agencies, Provision of real doctor / pharmacist or patient records, Client credit applications, Business financials (P&L, Balance Sheets, Bank Accounts)   </p>

<h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>

<p>After revision and looking at options, we have decided on creating this app using Amazon Web Services (AWS). There are a few reasons for this, one is that we can utilise all the AWS options available to implement different features that we need, also there is not upfront cost, as Microsoft Azure and others are based on a pay-per-minute model. We will also have the availability to quickly scale this app when more users come on board. Usually when professionals sign up to certain services as a legal requirement of their license, large influxes can occur close to its due date. Along with the option to expand quickly when we need more storage, we also have the benefit of not having to build and pay for servers that we will not be using during the start. There are multiple government programs that run on AWS as the security has been approved by the Australian Cyber Security Centre. As reported by ZDNet, Thursday's deal follows AWS in January receiving certification from the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), allowing the cloud behemoth to provide storage for highly sensitive government workloads out of its AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region. ZDNet 2019</p>

<p>Most of this program will be built from the ground up on Amazon Web Services IaaS toolset, this will allow cost reductions through efficiencies of scale. If we are successful in building and deploying this service with the help of the State Government, I believe the New South Wales (NSW) State Healthcare Industry would set a new standard for how healthcare professionals provide critical care to patients in Australia. The doctors and pharmacists would have a clear real time channel of communication with each other resulting in better outcomes for patients and avoiding any errors that occur due to breakdown in lines of communication.  </p>

<p>The following list shows the AWS tools we would need to use to create this app:</p>
<p><strong>Amazon SNS - Fast, flexible, fully managed push messaging service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon Cognito - Simple and Secure User Sign-Up, Sign-In, and Access Control.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon Pinpoint - Targeted Push Notifications for Mobile Apps.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon S3 - Secure, durable, and scalable object storage infrastructure.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon API Gateway - Publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon CloudFront - Web service to distribute content to end users with low latency and high transfer speeds.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon SQS - Scalable queue for storing messages as they travel between computers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AWS Amplify Hosting - Fully managed CI/CD and hosting service for fast, secure, and reliable static websites and server-side rendered web apps.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AWS ChatQL is a tool we would use to implement the ability to send chats.</strong></p>

<p>Based off the AWS Pricing Calculator the running costs at the start and prior to scaling will cost roughly $23,800. We would also in the future work on integrating this program with the government’s web-based program that handles QR Code scripts. This program is called MedView (known by professionals as Flow). Flow is a web application only; it handles the Electronic Scripts (also known as eRx) which is quickly becoming the industry standard. You can add to the queue of scripts in this application via either third-party apps (patients use) or by scanning the QR Code in using hardware in a pharmacy. Flow does not currently support any option for a doctor to send a script directly to a pharmacies queue. By only integrating our application with Flow it means we are not only giving Doctors the option to add a prescription to a pharmacies queue, but it also means we would not need to integrate it with any dispensing software which would be hard as there is a few different versions. This will save on costs as well as simplifies the workflow of our app.</p>

<p>End-to-end encryption is vital to maintaining patient trust whilst also adhering to Government standards. We hope to achieve this by configuring encryption ie SSL termination at ALB and also self-signed certs in web servers Aravind G V (2018) </p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>To achieve our collective aim, which outlines that we desire a robust and reliable platform for all doctors and pharmacists to use, we will require regular quality assurance testing. To begin our testing, it is financially viable to have a staff member complete the initial testing process, such as determining whether there are any coding errors or bugs within our platform and testing the response time and scope of the project.</p>

<p>For our prototype, our group has been fortunate to have a colleague know a Quality Assurance (QA) tester to assess our platform as we currently have it. The platform was provided to Mr Francis Qa’Ux of Testing Australia by Chris to provide some initial feedback. </p>

<p>The test took around 6 hours to complete, which included Mr Qa’Ux creating a testing plan and testing the functionality of two mock employees on the platform and testing the data’s security and function prior to authoring a report <strong>(devm.io, 2016)</strong>. As Mr Qa’Ux has been in the industry for around 5 years, he is well versed in his knowledge of QA and quoted his rate as being $410 for the job.</p>

<p>As far as the feedback report we received goes, we realised that whilst the platform has been initially designed well and has some fantastic simplistic user experience capacity, there are some minor areas of improvement for us.
For example, it was outlined that we can consider adding in some colour coding within messages to assist in distinguishing which pharmacy each message has come from via a “favourites” system to assist doctors and adding in a distinguishable alerts function. It was also discussed about adding a more effective Log Out system and some minor tweaks with some graphical errors within “Search” tab on the navigation bar.
This report was relayed onto the rest of our group, and Chris noted the recommendations as listed above and advised that he will be adjusting the interface of the platform as a result. This is exactly what we want to see when it comes to future testing and UI/UX development.
</p>

<p>Once we have completed our first few steps of our goal, such as completing a prototype and having a small control group test the platform’s effectiveness, we can receive valuable feedback as to our user design and expand our scope to include matters as discussed above, such as developing an efficient audio/video message function and receive recognition from government medical agencies.</p>

<p>Following this, our testing can either continue to be tested by our out-of-house QA tester Mr Qa’Ux or we can expand and outsource more QA testers the larger our scope becomes.</p>

<h2>Timeframe</h2>

<p>Insert Text here</p>

<h2>Risks</h2>

<p>No market research – what do the end users want (It may not be MedConnect). No defined strategic vision – what is most important (time, cost, or quality). No immediate understanding of what is actually required to develop the application. No prior knowledge of the software required or how to build the links & interfaces required. No real understanding of data encryption – highly confidential material, security is essential. No real understanding of the costs involved – difficult to establish a true ROI. No upfront budget. Relying on many assumptions. Ineffective team management. Last minute changes.</p>

<h2>Group Processes & Communication</h2>

<p>Our group (The IT Crowd) worked together on a previous assignment and chose to continue with the same structure for this assignment (other than losing one member of the group).  Our main form of communication is via Microsoft Teams (group chat, file sharing and live group meetings).  We generally meet at least twice per week on a Monday evening and Thursday evening.  Members of the group are based on the eastern seaboard of Australia with one member (Brett Russell) based in the West, this is sometimes challenging due to the 3 hours’ time difference between the states.  In general, the group has been able to coordinate time slots to suit all members, however work commitments sometimes created challenges.  Communication levels are high between the group however, so any absent members are always able to easily understand what has been missed and any actions that may be required. </p>

<h2>Group Reflection</h2>

<p><strong>JAKE BONE’s REFLECTION:</strong></p>
<p>With a great portion of the project focussing primarily on the project idea in its entirety, we struggled to know who should be doing what part and how. I feel like if we all decided this earlier, it would have reduced some of our early concerns of this assignment.
However, since our group works well together, we all came together and decided we each would utilise our strengths as our way of equally contributing within this assignment. I really feel like that our twice-weekly meetings worked well in quelling any issue that might be raised and that we all knew what we were doing and what we each were contributing to this assignment.
</p>

<p>I was overall surprised as to how much of a “business” assignment this became and how we needed to utilise our overall academic skills to tackle this project.
I learnt that groups work best when clear goals and achievements are set out, and that if someone knows what the goal is, then regardless of what the task is, teammates are typically happy. I found then if that teammate is struggling, others can step in and assist them as they also know what is expected of them. Personally, our group utilised Microsoft Teams as a major communication tool and most aspects of this project (barring the website) were contributed there. Personally, I felt that this worked well for us.
</p>

<p><strong>ALISTAIR MCLEOD’s REFLECTION:</strong></p>

<p>I found this assignment really pushed our team to start making clear decisions on what roles each member would take in order to start progressing on the project. At the beginning I think the team may have been a bit standoffish when it came to assigning roles or even certain members putting their hand up to take on work. Over the course of the project and with our regular meetings I felt the group really found that sweet spot in communicating and identifying what each member is good at/would prefer to work on which really opened things up for us as a team. </p>

<p>I found the assignment made me think a lot broader in regards to the project. I was very focussed on the IT aspects of trying to develop our idea without really thinking about how the project would be funded, how would we make revenue ect. Overall I think my greatest takeaway from working on this project with my fellow group members is when the communication is open how much easier it is to come together for the common course I felt lucky with the team I am in because the communication was great and really helped create a positive collaborative environment.</p>
