<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>Text Here</p>

<h2>Topic</h2>

<p>Our idea is to create an application network where health professionals and pharmacists can quickly and efficiently communicate with each other for patient-based specialised services and queries. It would focus predominantly on creating a direct line of communication between doctors (in both hospitals and private practices) and pharmacists (in both public and community settings). It would be available on desktop via a cloud service, this would be powered by cloud computing software, specifically Amazon Web Services (AWS). The program would also ideally be integrated with existing industry standard software used in the health space. </p>

<p>This project has come about from personal experience (Christopher McLeod) working in the healthcare space. Communication between pharmacists and doctors is practiced already in the industry as it’s such an important part of providing quality care to patients, but the methods used are time consuming and dated. Usually communication is via fax, phone, or email, with additional barriers at each step. A new state-wide system needs to be implemented to vastly improve the time taken out of healthcare workers days trying to communicate sometimes complex problems with one another before coming to a solution. “A review of medication safety from the National Prescribing Service show approximately 6% of hospital admissions are associated with adverse drug events and high error rates during transfer of care. Poor communication was the most important common factor contributing to medication errors. Increased interprofessional collaboration between doctors and pharmacists could therefore reduce the considerable medication-related morbidity and mortality" Easton K. (2009). </p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>After speaking directly with both pharmacists and a local Doctor, Christopher McLeod found that both would appreciate and benefit from such a system. Put simply, the benefit of this application would be to have a secure and direct line of communication between doctors, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals to avoid any errors. We hope this app will help with common errors that occur due to today's lack of professional communication. Common errors included: Duplication of therapy (either getting two of the same medication or two drugs in the same class). Omitted but necessary medications. Unreported use of herbals or dietary supplements TheConversation.com (2018). Common mistakes on prescriptions and issues with transferring of care can take up to 48 hours to resolve using today’s industry standard of communication between professionals. </p>

<p>This is an important application in the medical world and will help not just the doctors and pharmacists but ultimately the patients.  It is important to patients by reducing incorrect treatment being given which may result in needing further medical care (attendance to hospital for example) but on a less severe point it will also save the patient time by ensuring the information given to the pharmacist is able to be questioned instantly rather than having to send the patient away to return to see their doctor.  The application will fit within current IT trends, especially in the space of Cloud Computing and Mobile Apps, two of the highest trends in Information Technology.  Equally important as the trends themselves is the need to keep information safe, something we have done with our App which includes end-to-end data encryption.  Developing this app demonstrates our group’s ability to not only think strategically, looking to the future for better and more efficient ways of doing things, but also demonstrates the technical knowledge to be able to develop the application. </p>

<h2>Project Aim</h2>

<h2>Plans & Progess</h2>

<p>The IT Crowd project began by the group completing a survey of the possible options from each member. </p>

<p>The preferred project idea was initially selected as being Alistair’s mobile motor vehicle claims application.  After further group discussion and elaborating on the projects a change was decided and we went with that of our resident “Chemist in the making”, Christopher McLeod’s idea of developing software that connects Chemists to Doctors.</p>

<p>Chris was experiencing first-hand the challenges and frustrations that occur daily in a Chemist when customers attend only to find that the script they have presented is incorrect in some way.  From this Chris came up with the idea that customers and medical practitioners alike could benefit from a software or application that offers a form of professional connection platform which puts them in touch with one another in times of a customer delivering a script to a Chemist which is incomplete, or incorrect.  It would focus predominantly on creating a direct line of communication between doctors (in both hospitals and private practices) and pharmacists (in both public and community settings). It would be available on desktop via a cloud service, this would be powered by cloud computing software.  Common script errors included: Duplication of therapy (either getting two of the same medication or two drugs in the same class). Omitted but necessary medications. Unreported use of herbals or dietary supplements. Mistakes on prescriptions and issues with transferring of care can take up to 48 hours to resolve using today’s standard of communication between professionals.</p>

<p>As we began working in earnest on the project we first came up with a rough idea of what we thought would be required to get a mock project up and running, this included a high-level list of the tools and technologies required to build the application.  Chis did some of his own research and came up with the below list of tools and technologies to further develop into our project:
<ul>
<li>Amazon SNS - Fast, flexible, fully managed push messaging service.</li>
<li>Amazon Cognito - Simple and Secure User Sign-Up, Sign-In, and Access Control.</li>
<li>Amazon Pinpoint - Targeted Push Notifications for Mobile Apps.</li>
<li>Amazon S3 - Secure, durable, and scalable object storage infrastructure.</li>
<li>Amazon CloudFront - Web service to distribute content to end users with low latency and high transfer speeds.</li>
<li>Amazon API Gateway - Publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.</li>
<li>Amazon CloudFront - Web service to distribute content to end users with low latency and high transfer speeds.</li>
<li>Amazon SQS - Scalable queue for storing messages as they travel between computers.</li>
<li>AWS Amplify Hosting - Fully managed CI/CD and hosting service for fast, secure, and reliable static websites and server-side rendered web apps.</li>
<li>AWS ChatQL is a tool we would use to implement the ability to send chats.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>As we began trying to research the above list it became clear that we would not have either the time or the required knowledge and skill set to fully develop the application using all of the above.  It would require significant learning on majority of these listings to get a good enough understanding to be able to not just use them but use them well enough to demonstrate our project.  We also explored the use of Microsoft SQL server to create a mock database however as a group decided that we would not require this level of detail for the initial presentation.  In addition, we utilised the services of a work colleague to guide us on the practicality and time required to develop a form of web-based messaging service to actually show the interaction that would occur between a doctor and a chemist, however again it was decided that this would be above our capabilities at this stage. </p>

<p>Instead, what we did do, was first discuss with Pharmacists and Doctors what features would be essential to them in a program such as MedCONNECT. We found that the fundamentals we based our program on, such as simple, secure messaging with the ability to upload either a copy of a paper-based script or E-Script (also known as eRX, which comes in the form of a QR Code) would be the most helpful and make the most sense for them in their day-to-day workflow. I suggested the idea to a local Doctor in Leichhardt if an alert system for overdue messages or requests would be helpful. The feedback received was that this would also need to be an essential part of the system, as Doctors rely heavily on their staff to ensure they are attending all requests sent to them in a timely manner. With a program like MedCONNECT this feature would be baked into the system, and much like a doctor or Pharmacist logging into the software they use each day for their respective professions, MedCONNECT we envision would be much the same. An essential part of their workflow.</p>

<p>Moving forward with the feedback we decided to first create a detailed flowchart on paper, of how the website would run. From the landing page to login page to each respective tab. We discovered at this stage some tabs would be exclusive for each profession. For example, pharmacists wouldn’t need the ability to upload a script, but Doctors would. Doctors would need to know what scripts are owing, that are yet to be written for mutual patients, whilst Pharmacists would need the ability to see what scripts they’ve requested, but not yet received. This first draft of a flowchart allowed us to see if each step was quick, easy and made sense. We initially had a landing page with only 1 login portal, we quickly realised that in a real-world use case this wouldn’t work as Dr’s would be logging in most likely with a prescriber number, which identifies that individual. Whilst each Pharmacy location would have their own login, most likely an email, as the Pharmacist in charge in many places can change during the day/week. So, we decided to create a landing page where you selected if you’re logging in as a doctor or for your Pharmacy.   </p>

<p>Deciding how to display this idea as a prototype was challenging. We knew with our limited knowledge and time constraints we could either produce a visual design of a website on a program such as Adobe InDesign/Photoshop to convey what each page would look like. Or we could use prototyping software to create an interactive website, with limited features but more accurately portrayed the UI and UX of what the end user would experience. We ultimately decided to create as best we could a prototype of the website with Proto.io. Proto.io is an application prototyping software, which allows the user to create a prototype of an application that is currently in development.  </p>

<h2>Roles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jake Bone – <strong>Content Creator</strong> </li>
<li>Christopher McLeod – <strong>Project & Technical Design</strong> </li>
<li>Alistair McLeod – <strong>Content Creator</strong> </li>
<li>Brett Russell – <strong>Research and Group Administration</strong></li>
<li>Daniel Sodeman – <strong>Technical Analyst</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Scope and Limits</h2>

<p>In terms of development this is quite a large project to produce and implement.  Due to the limited time frame our group – The IT Crowd have decided to focus on a reduced number of key elements.  What is in scope: Software requirements specification, User task list, Developing the upfront web design demonstrating what the MedConnect App would look like.</p>

<p>Out of scope would include: Development of the interfaces required to connect and send live messages,
User acceptance testing, Approvals from government medical agencies, Provision of real doctor / pharmacist or patient records, Client credit applications, Business financials (P&L, Balance Sheets, Bank Accounts)   </p>

<h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>

<p>After revision and looking at options, we have decided on creating this app using Amazon Web Services (AWS). There are a few reasons for this, one is that we can utilise all the AWS options available to implement different features that we need, also there is not upfront cost, as Microsoft Azure and others are based on a pay-per-minute model. We will also have the availability to quickly scale this app when more users come on board. Usually when professionals sign up to certain services as a legal requirement of their license, large influxes can occur close to its due date. Along with the option to expand quickly when we need more storage, we also have the benefit of not having to build and pay for servers that we will not be using during the start. There are multiple government programs that run on AWS as the security has been approved by the Australian Cyber Security Centre. As reported by ZDNet, Thursday's deal follows AWS in January receiving certification from the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), allowing the cloud behemoth to provide storage for highly sensitive government workloads out of its AWS Asia Pacific (Sydney) Region. ZDNet 2019</p>

<p>Most of this program will be built from the ground up on Amazon Web Services IaaS toolset, this will allow cost reductions through efficiencies of scale. If we are successful in building and deploying this service with the help of the State Government, I believe the New South Wales (NSW) State Healthcare Industry would set a new standard for how healthcare professionals provide critical care to patients in Australia. The doctors and pharmacists would have a clear real time channel of communication with each other resulting in better outcomes for patients and avoiding any errors that occur due to breakdown in lines of communication.  </p>

<p>The following list shows the AWS tools we would need to use to create this app:
Amazon SNS - Fast, flexible, fully managed push messaging service.
Amazon Cognito - Simple and Secure User Sign-Up, Sign-In, and Access Control.
Amazon Pinpoint - Targeted Push Notifications for Mobile Apps.
Amazon S3 - Secure, durable, and scalable object storage infrastructure.
Amazon CloudFront - Web service to distribute content to end users with low latency and high transfer speeds.
Amazon API Gateway - Publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.
Amazon CloudFront - Web service to distribute content to end users with low latency and high transfer speeds.
Amazon SQS - Scalable queue for storing messages as they travel between computers.
AWS Amplify Hosting - Fully managed CI/CD and hosting service for fast, secure, and reliable static websites and server-side rendered web apps.
AWS ChatQL is a tool we would use to implement the ability to send chats.  </p>

<p>Based off the AWS Pricing Calculator the running costs at the start and prior to scaling will cost roughly $23,800. We would also in the future work on integrating this program with the government’s web-based program that handles QR Code scripts. This program is called MedView (known by professionals as Flow). Flow is a web application only; it handles the Electronic Scripts (also known as eRx) which is quickly becoming the industry standard. You can add to the queue of scripts in this application via either third-party apps (patients use) or by scanning the QR Code in using hardware in a pharmacy. Flow does not currently support any option for a doctor to send a script directly to a pharmacies queue. By only integrating our application with Flow it means we are not only giving Doctors the option to add a prescription to a pharmacies queue, but it also means we would not need to integrate it with any dispensing software which would be hard as there is a few different versions. This will save on costs as well as simplifies the workflow of our app.</p>

<p>End-to-end encryption is vital to maintaining patient trust whilst also adhering to Government standards. We hope to achieve this by configuring encryption ie SSL termination at ALB and also self-signed certs in web servers Aravind G V (2018) </p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>We have been fortunate to have a colleague know a Quality Assurance (QA) and User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) tester to assess our platform as we currently have it. The platform was provided to Mr Francis QA’UX of Testing Australia by Chris to provide some initial feedback.</p>

<p>Within the feedback report, we realised that whilst the platform has been initially designed well and has some fantastic simplistic user experience capacity, there are some minor areas of improvement for us.</p>

<h2>Timeframe</h2>

<h2>Risks</h2>

<p>No market research – what do the end users want (It may not be MedConnect)
No defined strategic vision – what is most important (time, cost, or quality)
No immediate understanding of what is actually required to develop the application
No prior knowledge of the software required or how to build the links & interfaces required
No real understanding of data encryption – highly confidential material, security is essential
No real understanding of the costs involved – difficult to establish a true ROI
No upfront budget
Relying on many assumptions
Ineffective team management
Last minute changes</p>

<h2>Group Processes & Communication</h2>

<p>Our group (The IT Crowd) worked together on a previous assignment and chose to continue with the same structure for this assignment (other than losing one member of the group).  Our main form of communication is via Microsoft Teams (group chat, file sharing and live group meetings).  We generally meet at least twice per week on a Monday evening and Thursday evening.  Members of the group are based on the eastern seaboard of Australia with one member (Brett Russell) based in the West, this is sometimes challenging due to the 3 hours’ time difference between the states.  In general, the group has been able to coordinate time slots to suit all members, however work commitments sometimes created challenges.  Communication levels are high between the group however, so any absent members are always able to easily understand what has been missed and any actions that may be required. </p>
